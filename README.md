Each platform has its own integration method. Please refer to the respective integration guidelines for details.  

To ensure the security of user assets, applications listed on the platform currently require manual approval. Therefore, before using the SDK, project teams must apply for relevant application information from the platform.  

## Supported Service Modules  

The P2 SDK is divided into multiple modules based on application scenarios. Each module provides its own set of services, and SDK integration is also modular.  

### 1. Account Services  

Services related to user accounts, including signing, basic information, and login.  

### 2. Ticket Services  

Applications on the platform generally adopt one of three payment models: free, one-time payment, or lifetime access via subscription.  

Ticket services include: checking tickets, creating one-time tickets, subscriptions, retrieving ticket information, and destroying tickets.  

### 3. Token Services  

Management of tokens supported within the platform, including balance inquiries, transactions, etc.  

### 4. NFT Services  

NFT-related management services, such as querying the NFT list of end users.  

### 5. Game Points Management  

Game points are independent for each application, mainly to facilitate operations and activities by the project team.  

Game points management includes consumption, rewards, and inquiries for both end users and merchants.  

### 6. Platform Points Management  

Management of user platform points, including consumption, inquiries, and other operations. When an application consumes points, user signature verification is required.
